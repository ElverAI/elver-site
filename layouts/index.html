    <h2>Synthetic Panels</h2>
    <p>Traditional message testing is powerful but slow. Recruiting the right sample, coordinating fieldwork, and iterating through multiple rounds of development can stall decision-making.</p>

    <p>Our synthetic panels allow you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pressure-test messages instantly</strong> across multiple audience definitions</li>
      <li><strong>Explore iterations early</strong>, long before formal quant or qual begins</li>
      <li><strong>Validate and compare concepts</strong> using your own benchmark data</li>
      <li><strong>Assess tone, clarity, relevance, and motivational impact</strong> with consistent, repeatable outputs</li>
      <li><strong>Scale early-stage learning</strong> without operational overhead</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Panels are configurable across demographics, attitudes, B2B profiles, category behaviours, and any proprietary segmentation you use. Each environment is built specifically for the research team that owns it – no shared models, no black boxes.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <h3>1. A Walled-Garden LLM Environment</h3>
    <p>We deploy and host open-source LLMs inside a private, controlled environment that belongs entirely to you. Your data never leaves your ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>2. Augmented With Your Data and Taxonomies</h3>
    <p>We fine-tune or augment the models using your historical studies, segmentations, and category knowledge, ensuring synthetic respondents reflect your established understanding of the market.</p>

    <h3>3. Rigorous Validation With Your Benchmarks</h3>
    <p>Outputs are continually compared against your real-world survey data, qual findings, and past message tests to ensure consistency and reliability.</p>

    <h3>4. Built Around Your Workflow</h3>
    <p>We integrate directly with the tools and processes your teams already use—no new platforms or learning curves. Researchers stay in control of how studies are structured, run, and interpreted.</p>

    <h3>5. You Own Everything</h3>
    <p>All IP, all training outputs, and all system components belong exclusively to you. The result is a long-term internal capability, not a dependency on a vendor.</p>
