## Synthetic Panels

Traditional message testing is powerful but slow. Recruiting the right sample, coordinating fieldwork, and iterating through multiple rounds of development can stall decision-making.

Our synthetic panels allow you to:

- **Pressure-test messages instantly** across multiple audience definitions
- **Explore iterations early**, long before formal quant or qual begins
- **Validate and compare concepts** using your own benchmark data
- **Assess tone, clarity, relevance, and motivational impact** with consistent, repeatable outputs
- **Scale early-stage learning** without operational overhead

Panels are configurable across demographics, attitudes, B2B profiles, category behaviours, and any proprietary segmentation you use. Each environment is built specifically for the research team that owns it – no shared models, no black boxes.

## How It Works

### 1. A Walled-Garden LLM Environment

We deploy and host open-source LLMs inside a private, controlled environment that belongs entirely to you. Your data never leaves your ecosystem.

### 2. Augmented With Your Data and Taxonomies

We fine-tune or augment the models using your historical studies, segmentations, and category knowledge, ensuring synthetic respondents reflect your established understanding of the market.

### 3. Rigorous Validation With Your Benchmarks

Outputs are continually compared against your real-world survey data, qual findings, and past message tests to ensure consistency and reliability.

### 4. Built Around Your Workflow

We integrate directly with the tools and processes your teams already use—no new platforms or learning curves. Researchers stay in control of how studies are structured, run, and interpreted.

### 5. You Own Everything

All IP, all training outputs, and all system components belong exclusively to you. The result is a long-term internal capability, not a dependency on a vendor.
